Hey there, this is Arijit! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a 14 year old who loves developing Open-Source stuff which can enhance our social ecosystem. Currently I work at [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com) as their Ambassador and an Event Ambassador at [The Things Network](https://thethingsnetwork.com/conference). 

I love to work on projects that involve a mix of IoT with Machine Learning. 
I stongly believe on the fact that "Anyone can be anything" :) 

Wanna ask for some help involving ML on Edge Devices / Collaborate on some cool Open-Source projects ?

Don't forget to drop me an email , always happy to help :)
