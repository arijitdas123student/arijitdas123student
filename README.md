Hi I'm Arijit! ðŸ‘‹
I am a 14 year old who loves developing Open-Source stuff which can enhance our social ecosystem. I am one of the Ambassador at Edge Impulse and an Event Ambassador at The Things Network. 

I love to work on projects that involve a mix of IoT with Machine Learning. 
I stongly believe on the fact that "Anyone can be anything". 

Wanna ask for some help involving ML on Edge Devices / Collaborate on some cool Open-Source projects ?

Don't forget to mail me at arijitdas18022006@gmail.com , always happy to help :)
